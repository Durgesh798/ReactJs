	<p><b> Our founder Sam Walton was the most notable business leader of his time but no matter how much success
		he achieved, he never forgot where it all started. Once a humble entrepreneur with a successful 
		five-and-dime, Mr. Sam knew firsthand the challenges of running a small business.Passionate for 
		leadership through service, Mr. Sam wanted to leverage his resources to help other entrepreneurs like 
		himself access the products and services they needed to make their small businesses succeed. That’s why
		in 1983, he opened the first Sam’s Club in Midwest City, Okla.Today, Sam’s Club wants to be the most 
		valuable membership for our members. We have grown to offer solutions not just for entrepreneurs and 
		small businesses, but also for families and everyday living as we know that these two members shop the 
		same way. Sam’s Club serves millions of members at SamsClub.com and almost 600 locations across the U.S. 
		and Puerto Rico</b></p>

		<p><b>
		Sam’s Club is a membership warehouse club, a limited-item business model that offers our members 
		quality products at an exceptional value unmatched by traditional retail.Instead of stocking every 
		item in every available brand, Sam’s Club merchants do their homework for our members, stocking the 
		right products and purchasing them in large quantities, passing on the savings to our members. 
		We also reduce costs by maintaining a simple shopping environment, often displaying our merchandise 
		on shipping pallets so we can move new items in just as quickly as they move out.</b></p>

		<p><b>
		Sam’s Club also provides a variety of member benefits such as free shipping on most items for our Plus 
		members along with Cash Rewards, early shopping, savings on medications as well as the benefits of our 
		Club membership. Club members can take advantage of Sam’s Club Credit, Instant Savings, free health 
		screenings, daily “Tastes & Tips” sampling demonstrations and members-only savings on fuel.Nothing 
		mattered more to Mr. Sam than serving his customers, and it is to this commitment that he attributed 
		his immense success. “Our philosophy has always been simple,” he once said. “We are the agents for our 
		customers.” At Sam’s Club, we live out his promise by delivering simple savings to our members on items 
		they can trust. Life is better in the club – anywhere, anytime.</b></p>
